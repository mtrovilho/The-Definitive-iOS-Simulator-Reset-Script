The Definite iOS Simulator Reset Script
=======================================

Created after being inspired by [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5125243/how-can-i-reset-the-ios-simulator-from-the-command-line/).


What's this?
------------
Gotta reset you're iOS Simulator? Gotta reset more than just one? What about *all* iOS versions or *all* device types? Good luck doing that manually.

Download this script! Run it! Awesomeness guaranteed!
